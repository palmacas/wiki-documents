## <span id="jump1"> Camera </span>
Regarding the camera call, we have adapted node for recamera, you can get the camera's image data in node-red.
<br />
Connect the recamera to your computer using **type-c** and access node-red by visiting `192.168.42.1:1880`. You can also access node-red from your recamera network on port `LocalIP:1880` after the recamera is connected.
<br />
After the image configuration, you can get the camera's base64 image data and the RTSP's H.264 image push data.

```
## <span id="jump2">Light</span>

There are four indicators on the recamera, three of which are controllable indicators and the **green** indicator is the power indicator. 
Among them, there are four **white** lights, which are the fill lights of the camera.
**Red** is the status indicator of the CPU and **blue** is the reading status indicator of the system emmc.
<br />
The switch of the fill light and the red and blue indicator lights can be controlled by the following instructions.

``` bash
echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/leds/leds/white/brightness //light on
echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/leds/leds/white/brightness //light off

echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/leds/leds/red/brightness //red indicator
echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/leds/leds/red/brightness 

echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/leds/leds/blue/brightness //blue indicator
echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/leds/leds/blue/brightness 
```

## <span id="jump3">Mic && Speaker</span>

The recamera has a microphone and a speaker. You can invoke the microphone and speaker by following the command. The recamera can play audio files in **wav** format.

The default format of the player is: 16bit bitrate; The sampling rate is 16,000

```bash
sudo arecord -D hw:0,0 -r 16000 -f S16_LE -c 1 -d 5 /home/recamera/test.wav //Record five seconds of audio

sudo aplay -D hw:1,0 /home/recamera/test.wav //Playing audio
```

## <span id="jump4">WIFI</span>

The wifi of recamera is AP+STA dual mode, which can be used to configure the device 
network or configure the device in AP mode.

The **SSID** of wifi in AP mode is: `reCamera_+ the last six bits of MAC`.
<br />
The **Passwd** of wifi in AP mode is: `12345678`.
<br />
The ssid and passwd of the WiFi_AP can be configured in the
 /etc/hostapd_2g4.conf file on the recamera system.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/image-2.png" /></div>

The reCamera STA configuration file is in **/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf**, where you configure the WiFi account and password to connect to.
In STA mode, please connect to WiFi in **5G** band.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/image-3.png" /></div>

In the terminal, you can scan and connect to WiFi with the following command:

```bash
wpa_cli -i wlan0 scan                           #Start a scan

wpa_cli -i wlan0 scan_results                   #Returns wifi scan results

wpa_cli add_network                             # Adding a new network,Returns a network ID
wpa_cli set_network ID ssid "your_wifi_name"    # set network SSID
wpa_cli set_network ID psk "your_wifi_password" # set network passwd
wpa_cli enable_network ID                       # enable network and connect
wpa_cli status                                  # Checking connection status
```

## <span id="jump5">SD Card</span>

The SD card slot can expand the storage space of the recamera. After inserting the SD card, you can find the existence of your SD by using the `lsblk` command.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/image-5.png" /></div>

Once you have found a storage device like mmcblk1p1, you can mount it to your system using the following command.
<br/>

Note that recamera only recognizes **ext4** filesystems.

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/mmcblk1p1 #If TYPE is not ext4, the filesystem needs to be formatted
/dev/mmcblk1p1: UUID="F080-C970" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="exfat" PARTUUID="04ec0085-01"

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk1p1 #Format the filesystem to ext4
mkdir /userdata/mmcblk1 #Create a mount file
sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/mmcblk1p1 /userdata/mmcblk1 #Mount the SD card to the /userdata/mmcblk1 path
```
Check the mount result by `lsblk`

## <span id="jump6">Uart (Debug)</span>

The base circuit board of the recamera has three contacts tx,rx, and gnd, which serve as the debug serial port of the recamera.

<div align="center"><img width={400} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/image-7.png" /></div>

The device has a serial port baud rate of 115200 and can log into the recamera system.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/image-8.png" /></div>

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/image-9.png" /></div>

## <span id="jump7">User Button</span>

The reCamera's usr button can be customized by the user.

<div align="center"><img width={400} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reCamera/image-10.png" /></div>

```bash
echo "510" > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo "in" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio510/direction #Enable the input mode
cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio510/value #When the key is pressed, 0 is printed
```
