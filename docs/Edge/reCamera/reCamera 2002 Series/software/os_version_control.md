# OS Update/Upgrade Guideline with Web
Connect the recamera to your computer using the type-c cable, and go to `http://192.168.42.1/#/system` in your computer's browser, or replace the IP address if you are visiting the device via network. Before upgrading, make sure reCamera has **access to the internet** by checking `ip_address/#/network`.

Click `System` Configuration, and if a new firmware is released, click `Apply` to update/upgrade the device system. The button text would be "Check" if there is no new firware auto detected.

Wait for the progress bar to complete.

Click `Restart` to complete the system update/upgrade. **Refresh the browser** around 30 seconds to reconnect to the device.

The system will automatically check if there is a new version of firmware that can be updated/upgrade.

### Device management by OTA
#### Update/Upgrade to latest OTA version
You can check out the latest version of the [reCamera OS here.](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/reCamera-OS)

Manually update/upgrade the latest OTA firmware:
```bash
#Upgrade to the latest firmware version
/mnt/system/upgrade.sh latest https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/reCamera-OS/releases/latest 

/mnt/system/upgrade.sh start
```
or
#### Update/Upgrade or rollback to any specific OTA version
If you have a speicific version you would like to deploy, you can use the command below.
```bash
#E.g. install 0.1.4 as an example
/mnt/system/upgrade.sh latest https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/reCamera-OS/releases/tag/0.1.4

/mnt/system/upgrade.sh start
```
If you are developing OS and you have your own branch in github, you can also update/upgrade the system version with your branch link.
```bash
/mnt/system/upgrade.sh latest https://github.com/your-user-name/reCamera-OS/releases/your-version-file-address

/mnt/system/upgrade.sh start

### Device management by local package
You can also update/upgrade the firmware manually using the local ota package. The ota firmwares can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/reCamera-OS/releases/). Use tools like scp to transfer the files to reCamera.
```bash
scp sg2002_reCamera_0.1.3_emmc_ota.zip recamera@ip_address
```

```bash
/mnt/system/upgrade.sh start sg2002_reCamera_0.1.3_emmc_ota.zip

### Manually restore factory Settings.
